The open oceans project was created to enumerate the tools I have written for easy accessibility to open ocean data or those to be gathered from the larger ocean science community. Currently the organization page, tools and subsets are my work and I hope to expand this to those who would like to contribute and be part of the effort.

Each of the tools includes have their own readme page where you will get the most updated information. Just click on the link to a specific tool for their own readme page
