The open oceans project was created to enumerate the tools an open ocean data available easily or to be gathered from the larger ocean science community. While some of the tools and subsets are my work this is largely a community contributed project and includes projects and datasets from other sources as part of the effort.

Each of the tools have their own readme page where you will get the most updated information. Just click on the link to a specific tool
